# Sharpe-MonteCristo
Basic framework of code I had running on a RaspberryPi that automatically sends me market updates, with prices and associated technical indicators. Calculates Sharpe Ratio and runs a Monte Carlo Simulation for selected financial products to identify the "optimised" portfolio distribution according to Modern Portfolio Theory.
